# Analysis: FIJI Macro scripts

**Purpose**: Determine mean fluorescence intensity, count Maurer’s cleft, and determine particle co-occurrence from widefield images of indirect immunofluorescence assays.

**Data produced**: Mean fluorescence intensity, Maurer’s cleft counts, and particle co-occurrence. Data, produced as a table in FIJI, was copied to Excel for storage and visualized and statistcally tested using [GraphPad Prism 9.2.0](https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/) Macintosh Version by Software MacKiev © 1994-2021.

**Analysis software**: FIJI 2.1.0
