# Analysis: FIJI Macro scripts

**Purpose**: Fractionate the cytoplasm and cleft fluorescence from widefield images of indirect immunofluorescence assays to determine mean fluorescence intensity of anti-EMP1 in either compartment. The co_occurrence scripts determine particle co-occurrence using Huygens deconvolved [1] widefield images.

**Data produced**: Mean fluorescence intensity of anti-EMP1 in the cytoplasm and/or cleft, Maurer’s cleft counts (determined by anti-REX1), and particle co-occurrence. Data, produced as a table from FIJI, was copied to Excel for storage before visualization and statistcal testing with [GraphPad Prism 9.2.0](https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/) Macintosh Version by Software MacKiev © 1994-2021.

**Figures in manuscript**: Used to generate data depicted in Fig 1, 3, S2, and S8.

**Analysis software**: FIJI 2.1.0
