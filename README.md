# EMP1 trafficking 

This repository contains the analysis scripts associated with the manuscript titled 'Virulence determinant, PTP7, controls vesicle budding from the Maurer’s clefts, adhesin protein trafficking and host cell remodeling in Plasmodium falciparum'. The project was led by Olivia Carmo and analysis scripts were written or guided by Dr. Dezerae Cox (this repository adapted from a recent [Cox publication](https://github.com/dezeraecox-manuscripts/COX_Proteome-stability)). This manuscript is in preparation and a final verison will be available upon publication. 

## Prerequisites

Packages required can be accessed in the ```environment.yml``` file availabe in each analysis folder. To create a new conda environment containing all packages, run ```conda create -f environment.yml```. Analysis generated by these scripts were visualized and statistically tested using [GraphPad Prism v 8.0](https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/). 

## Raw data and databases

To review raw images only, download the relevant dataset with the suffix '-raw-images' from the open-access [Zenodo dataset](https://sandbox.zenodo.org/record/888160). For convenience, preprocessed masks and validation have been uploaded alongside the raw images. 

## Workflow

To view masks and validate appropriate object classification, all analysis results are available as an open-access [Zenodo dataset](https://sandbox.zenodo.org/record/888160). To reproduce analysis presented in the manuscript run the ```0_data_retrieval.py``` script, skip the ```0_initial_cleanup.py``` script (used to rename files, redundant here), then proceed with scripts in the order indicated by the script number.
